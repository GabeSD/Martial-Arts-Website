     <h1 class="center">Reaction Time</h1>
     <p class="flow-text ts">There were two different types of tests that were conducted on the subjects to test their reaction time. There was a visual and auditory reaction time test. In the visual test, the subjects went to the website Humanbenchmark.com to take its well crafted reaction time test. After five attempts, the tests will give their average reaction time in milliseconds.</p>
     <p class="flow-text ts">After the visual reaction test, the subjects went on the website, cognitivefun.net. This test was set up to allow the subject to react once a sound was played through the computer. It would then tell how fast your average speed was in reacting in milliseconds as well.</p>
     <p class="flow-text ts">Here are the link to the test if you want to try them yourself:</p>

 <div class="container-fluid">
   <h1 class="center">Awareness</h1>
   <p class="flow-text ts">There were two different types of awareness tests. As like the reaction time tests, the awareness tests also tested visual and auditory awareness. The visual awareness test was a video that created a lot of distraction while the subject had to count how many times the people in the video passed the ball to one another. In the end the subject ahs to guess how many times the ball was passed.</p>
   <p class="flow-text ts">In the auditory reaction test, I created a situation where the subjects had to use hearing to identify how far a certain person is away from them and thier position from the subject. A subject stands in the middle of a ten foot in diameter circle and has to close their eyes. Another person walks arounf them for twenty seconds and after twenty seconds, the subject has to identify how many feet away the subject is from them and which side of they are facing the subject. </p>
    <p class="flow-text ts">Here is a link to the visual awareness test and the auditroy awareness test methodology:</p>
